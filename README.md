# Chrome Site Blocker

A simple, privacy-friendly Chrome extension that helps you block distracting or inappropriate websites.  

- Block any site by typing it in or blocking the current tab  
- Temporary **unblock** with time limits (2, 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes)  
- **Parent Mode**: requires a master password to unblock or change settings  
- Clean UI with one-click site management  
- Works fully offline — no accounts, no data collection

##Features

- **Block Sites**  
  Add domains manually (e.g., `reddit.com`) or block the current tab with one click.

- **Temporary Unblock**  
  Need to consult the reddit overlords? Temporarily unblock for 2–30 minutes.  
  - When **Parent Mode** is OFF → no password required  
  - When **Parent Mode** is ON → master password required

- **Parent Mode**  
  - Lock down the extension with a password  
  - Prevent changes to blocked sites  
  - Require password for temporary unblocks  
  - Disable Parent Mode only with the password  

- **Password Security**  
  - Master password stored as a **salted PBKDF2 hash** (never plaintext)  
  - No accounts, no cloud storage, no tracking  

**IMPORTANT NOTE: 
  -If you forget your password, you will need to uninstall and re-install. In order to preserve data privacy I opted to not need a formal account to use this extension. You can change your password at any time without knowing your current if "parent mode" is disabled. To ensure kids don't uninstall the extension to bypass the controls, it's suggested to use a monitored google account.
